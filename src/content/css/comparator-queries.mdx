### Comparator Container Queries

Sure this is nice, but nothing revolutionary (haha, I'm such a cynic).

```css
@media (400px <= width <= 1000px) {
  /* etc. */
}
```

### Container Units

So far, I don't get these. As in `1cqw` appears to just be the same thing as `1%`?

### Container Queries

```css
@container optional-named-container (max-width: 500px) {
  .selector {
    display: inline;
  }
}
```
