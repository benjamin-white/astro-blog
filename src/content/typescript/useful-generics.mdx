```tsx
type WithCSSClass<T = object> = T & { className?: string };

type WithCSStyle<T = object> = T & { style?: CSSStyleRule };

type HTMLButtonAttribs = JSX.IntrinsicElements["button"];

type ButtonProps = HTMLButtonAttribs & {
  customAttrib: boolean;
};

type Children = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

// all intrinisic props but fixed type
type SubmitButtonProps = Omit<JSX.IntrinsicElements["button"], "type"> &
  Children;

const SubmitButton = ({ children, ...buttonAttribs }: SubmitButtonProps) => (
  <button type="submit" {...buttonAttribs}>
    {children}
  </button>
);

// use a MakeRequired generic to support all img attribs but with the alt and src as required
type MakeRequired<T, K extends keyof T> = Omit<T, K> &
  Required<{ [P in K]: T[P] }>;

type ImgProps = MakeRequired<JSX.IntrinsicElements["img"], "alt" | "src">;
```

## **_Event Types_**

React has typings to match the native events. That means for them to work you must use the React types not the native ones, eg.

```tsx
import { MouseEvent } from "react";
// to do..
MouseEvent;
// or use..
React.MouseEvent;
```

Supported event types are:

- AnimationEvent
- ChangeEvent
- ClipboardEvent
- CompositionEvent
- DragEvent
- FocusEvent
- FormEvent
- KeyboardEvent
- MouseEvent
- PointerEvent
- TouchEvent
- TransitionEvent
- WheelEvent
- SyntheticEvent (for anything else, including at the time of writing input events)

Events may be restricted to 1+ nodes by adding a generic to the event type, eg.

```tsx
MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement | HTMLAnchorElement>;
```
