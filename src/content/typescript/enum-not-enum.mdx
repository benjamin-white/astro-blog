Some peope say don't do this...

```ts
const GENRE = {
  ROMANTIC: "romantic",
  DRAMA: "drama",
  COMEDY: "comedy",
  DOCUMENTARY: "documentary",
};
```

Instead do this...

```ts
enum GENRE {
  ROMANTIC,
  DRAMA,
  COMEDY,
  DOCUMENTARY,
}
```

Which makes sense, as the repetition is weird... but what are the values at runtime this way and does this cause any tripwires with automatic numeric keys?
