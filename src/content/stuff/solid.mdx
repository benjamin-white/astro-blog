SOLID Principles compelement each other and work together in unison to achieve the purpose of well-designed software.

Primarily derived from Object Oriented Programming, their ideas (while not neccessarily one to one relatable) are applicable in concept at least to other paradigms.

### Single Responsibility Principle

Following SRP encourages high cohesion and low coupling.

_Every software component should have one and only one responsibility._

_Every software component should have one and only one reason to change._

_Do one thing and do it well. &mdash; **Linux philosophy**_

This student object allows us to retrieve the institution fees for a student instance, which seems handy.

```ts
class Student {
  constructor(studentId) {
    this.studentId = studentId;
  }

  get fees() {
    return this.calculateFees(this.studentId);
  }

  calculateFees(studentId) {
    return "calculates the fees";
  }
}

new Student(0).fees;
```

But it doesn't seem right the student object is calculating the fees. It seems like a mixed up responsibility, so we could move calculating and dealing with fees to an object whose remit is solely fees.

```ts
class Student {
  constructor(studentId, FeesService) {
    this.studentId = studentId;
    this.FeesService = FeesService;
  }

  get fees() {
    return FeesService.calculateFees(this.studentId);
  }
}

class FeesService {
  static calculateFees(studentId) {
    return "calculates the fees";
  }
}

new Student(0).fees;
```

That seems much better, but really the student doesn't need to concern itself with fees _at all_. Accessing the fees directly from a student object is handy, but doesn't justify the potential ambiguity around responsibilities we could run into even still. Let's let that go and remove any notion of fees from `Student`.

```ts
class Student {
  #studentId;

  constructor(studentId) {
    this.#studentId = studentId;
  }

  get id() {
    return this.#studentId;
  }
}

class FeesService {
  static calculateFees(studentId) {
    return "calculates the fees";
  }
}

FeesService.calculateFees(new Student(0).id);
```

### Open-Closed Principle / OCP

_Software components should be closed for modification, but open for extension._

New features being added to a software component should not have to modify the code of the component. The component should expose an API that supports its extending with new features. If this API is designed well pluggging in new functionality can be straightforward and ensures accidental pollution of the component does not happen.

Implementing the Open-Closed principle often requires decoupling, which in turn improves the seperation of concerns / SRP.

Let's take a very basic example of a method that calculates a discount for a price object.

```js
class PriceCalculator {
  static discountAmount = 0.2;
  static calculateCustomerDiscount(price, customer) {
    return customer.isLoyalCustomer ? price * (1 - this.discountAmount) : price;
  }
}
```

That was ok, but if we wanted to calculate different types of discount and/or different amounts in the future we're a bit stuck. We would have to dive in and start modifying the internals of the `PriceCalculator` class. As it happens we actually left the `discountAmount` property as public, so a consumer of this class could change the `discountAmount`, but this is in fact bad news. Leaving the `discountAmount` directly updatable from outside could trip us up, imagine we changed it to calculate the discount for a trade customer but forgot to reset it before calculating for a consumer customer!

If we externalise the relationship between customer properties and discount we can add more types of discount, elligibility criteria and discount amounts in the future without the need to _modify_ the `PriceCalculator`.

```ts
const discountsLookUp = [
  {
    type: "loyalty",
    isElligble: (customer) => customer.isLoyal,
    amount: 0.2,
  },
  {
    type: "concession",
    isElligble: (customer) => customer.age > 65,
    amount: 0.15,
  },
];

class PriceCalculator {
  static calculateCustomerDiscount(price, customer, discountsLookUp) {
    const discount = discountsLookUp.reduce(
      (acc, cur) => (cur.isElligble(customer) ? acc + cur.amount : acc),
      0
    );
    return price * (1 - discount);
  }
}
```

### Liskov Substitution Principle / LSP

_Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program &mdash; **Barbara Liskov**_ Perhaps more succinctly _a subtype should not change the assumptions about its supertype_.

_If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck and needs batteries &mdash; you probably have the wrong abstraction._ This quote highlights how the LSP is guiding to avoid some of the potential pitfalls with "is-a" thinking / duck typing.

By definition the LSP will satisfy [The Principle of Least Asstonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment)

```js
abstract class Shape {
  #label: string

  constructor(label: string) {
    this.#label = label
  }

  getLabel() {
    return this.#label
  }

  abstract getArea(): number
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  #radius: number

  constructor(label: string, radius: number) {
    super(label)
    this.#radius = radius
  }

  getArea() {
    return this.#radius * Math.PI ** 2
  }
}
```

The thing to note here is the handling of the `getArea` method. Any child class extending `Shape` should honour this signature.

### Interface Segregation Principle

_A client should never be forced to implement an interface or depend on a method it doesn't use._

So we can see that not adopting ISP can lead to 'gorilla and banana' problems. Joe Armstrong, the principal inventor of Erlang, is quoted as saying: _"The problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle."_.

**Example violations of ISP**

- Fat Interfaces
- Interfaces with low cohesion
- Empty method implementations

**Example problem:**

```js
class User {
  constructor(username) {
    this.username = username;
  }

  skipAd() {
    console.log("Skipping ad");
  }
}

class FreeUser extends User {
  constructor(username) {
    super(username);
  }
}

class PremiumUser extends User {
  constructor(username) {
    super(username);
  }
}

const premiumUser = new PremiumUser(`name`);
premium.skipAd();
// 'Skipping ad'
const freeUser = new FreeUser(`name`);
free.skipAd();
// 'Skipping ad'
// the problem here is the ability to skip ads was only meant to be a premium feature!
```

**Better design:**

```js
class User {
  constructor(username) {
    this.username = username;
  }
}

class FreeUser extends User {
  constructor(username) {
    super(username);
  }
}

class PremiumUser extends User {
  constructor(username) {
    super(username);
  }

  skipAd() {
    console.log("Skipping ad");
  }
}

const premiumUser = new PremiumUser(`name`);
premiumUser.skipAd();
// 'Skipping ad'
const freeUser = new FreeUser(`name`);
freeUser.skipAd();
// Uncaught TypeError: freeUser.skipAd is not a function
// which is definitely better, a free user does indeed not support skipping ads!
```

### Dependency Inversion

_High level code should never depend on low level interfaces, instead using abstractions._

Basically don't hard code dependencies / specific implementations into your objects! For example...

```js
class MariaDatabase {
  static add(item) {
    // does something
  }
}
class User {
  static create(userObject) {
    MariaDatabase.add(userObject);
  }
}
```

...where `User` now implicitly depends on `MariaDatabase` and is tightly coupled to it!

Instead let's create a database interface which is an _abstraction_ of the database and use _dependency injection_ to pass this abstraction into the `User` class. The `User` will now know nothing about MariaDB, Mongo or whatever but only that it recieves a database interface with an add method. This limits future updates or refactoring to the database implementation to the abstraction of it, which is correct as the `User` should not care about those specifics. This is similiar to the _Interpreter Pattern_ where we add an intermediary between objects so neither needs to know the specifics of the other (we introduce a common interface as an abstraction).

```js
class MariaDatabase {
  static add(item) {
    // does something
  }
}
class DatabaseRepositry {
  constructor(connectionType) {
    this.connectionType = connectionType;
  }
  addUser(user) {
    switch (this.connectionType) {
      case "MARIA":
        MariaDatabase.add(user);
      // etc.
    }
  }
}
class User {
  constructor(dbConnection) {
    this.db = dbConnection;
  }
  create(userObject) {
    this.db.addUser(userObject);
  }
}

const user = new User(new DatabaseRepositry("MARIA"));
```

This is now definitely more code but the user is much more versatile and we have more freedom to update the specifics of a database connection or add / remove connection types as the `User` no longer depends on any specifics.
